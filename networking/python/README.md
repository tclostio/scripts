These are mostly alternatives to commonly installed CLI tools you might find on Windows or Linux servers.
They're handy because some sysadmins remove tools like netcat from their systems, to avoid misuse or exploitation. You can usually always still find a Python install though.

Note: these are written in Python 2.7.11 unless otherwise specified.
